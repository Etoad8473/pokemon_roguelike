MOVEMENT:
*create the entire 401:401 world made of different maps
--the gates have to align
-gates positions are controlled
-make the map its own data struct
*make it controllable from command line - ("Current position is 200WX200N (-200, -200) Enter command: ")
--commands: n,e,s,w,q,f
--f x y
---READING INPUT: scanf("%d %d", x y )

EXAMPLE
while((c = getc())){
    switch(c);
        case 'q': 
            exit();
            break;
        case 'f': 
            scanf("%d %d", &x &y);
}


To do:
*make the road in points controlled


Notes:
map_t *world[401][401] //if it is NOT a pointer, the array would be number_of_tiles * bytes_in_map
//with it being a pointer, the array is only num_of_tiles * 8 bytes (pointer size)
