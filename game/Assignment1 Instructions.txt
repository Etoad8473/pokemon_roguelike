80*21 map

TYPES OF TERRAIN:
water
mountain
forest
tall grass
short grass


HOW TO:
make them rectangles, overriding previous
-border of map has impassable borders (rocks & trees)
-short grass everywhere first (inside rock and tree border)
-place water
-place mountain
-place forest
-tall grass
randomly place some trees & tall grass


choos pos of gate for all 4 walls
connect left and right gates
-randomly choose X pos to turn road, randomly choose Y to turn road again

to get direction of path: (y1 - y2)/|(y1 - y2)|


Place pokemark & pokecenter next to row
2x2 m & 2x2 cc
if not next to road,, build road to it

BETTER:
choose random points as the terrain
using queue grow each terrain type by infecting adjacent cells until you hit another terrain type
each terrain has gradient elevation between them
roads use dijkstras with elevation as additional weight,, and penalty weight for being near the edge
scatter boulders & trees
