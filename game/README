FUNCTIONALITY:
This week you can move between maps and fly to new maps. 


TO RUN:
make
./poke


NOTES:
-when pressing escape from any cutscene (fly, trainer list, pokebattle) it takes just a second to load
-the inputs of the fly command go past the height of the default terminal size


BUGS:
none that I know of.
