FUNCTIONALITY:
This program runs the game, moving the NPCs around the map
Hikers and rivals will chase the PC (player Character), other NPCs will move as per the spec


TO RUN:
make
./poke --numtrainers <number>

you can run it without the switch and it will default to 5
<number> must be between [-1:50], -1 sets it to the default


NOTES:
-There is an intentional short pause between map printings for readability
-The PC always spawns in front of the west gate, and does not move (as per the spec)
-When NPC's try to enter a character occupied space, they do not move (allowed as per spec)
    -this occasionally results in characters getting stuck on eachother if they are both trying to move into eachothers space
-Hikers and Rivals look drunk: 
    -they are taking the shortest path but because diagonals are equal length, sometimes it looks like they stumble around
-Rare 'weird' looking behavior (accepted by the spec):
    -wanderers can appear stuck if they spawn on a single piece of tall grass (I've never seen this but it technically can happen, but is still technically correct as per spec)


BUGS:
none that I know of
