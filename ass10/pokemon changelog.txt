DEBUGGING MEMORY ERROR
-change all instantiations of things to new -> fixed the invalid pointer error
-remove all deletes -> fixed the munmemchunk errors
Getting the thing to print the blockface hit arrays
remove the player from the hitBlock calculation
test colors
start colors and add the color init
