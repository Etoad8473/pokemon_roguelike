TO RUN:
make
./poke

This will print the map, the hiker's distances, and the rival's distance maps.
Each time you run it it will generate a new map with corresponding distance maps.

Notes:
for unreachable distances I opted to print "--" instead 
of a double space as I found that it reads more clearly.
