FUNCTIONALITY:
This program runs the game with 15 trainers (for scrolling capabilities), you move the PC with controls as per the spec


TO RUN:
make
./poke


NOTES:
-when exiting the pokemon battle or the trainer list, it takes just a second to load (idk why),, if you also press q the input will process before the screen can print and the game will end.
-it sometimes looks like the trainers battle you from 1 block away. They are actually moving into contact with you but the cutscene to the pokemon battle happens a split second after the screen shows them making contact. I tried adding a delay but that created input bugs where the game would keep playing in the background. Anyways this only looks like a bug but is fine per the spec.


BUGS:
none that I know of.
