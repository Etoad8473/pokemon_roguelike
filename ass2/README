this was a lot of work

works for all 6 input types nswefq
also works for incorrect input types
pokemarts & centers spawn together, but their probability is per the specification
borders of the world have roads blocked off

BUG:
if you put in multiple inputs in the same line it will run on all of them and possibly crash
