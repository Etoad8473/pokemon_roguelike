FUNCTIONALITY:
Pokemon game with wild pokemon battles and trainer battles

TO RUN:
make
./poke


NOTES:

NOT IMPLEMENTED:
-Items (pokeballs, revives, healing potions)
-Switching between pokemon mid battle

BUGS:
It's not super stable, I had a stable version but tried to add the remaining features
with too little time, messing up what I did have working perfectly
It works for the most part though.
